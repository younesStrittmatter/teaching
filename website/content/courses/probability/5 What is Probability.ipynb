    "## Probability as Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way of thinking about probability is as a measure of uncertainty. For example, think about blindly rolling a die. Before looking at the outcome, we are uncertain about the outcome (although the outcome is already determined and the die has a specific number on top). The probability of each outcome is $\\frac{1}{6}$. In other words we are uncertain about the outcome. If we had to chose, we would say a specific number between 1 and 6, but we would be very uncertain about the outcome. No matter what number we would choose, we would be right only 1 out of 6 times. This is the uncertainty of the outcome. In this sense, probability is a language about expressing \"that we don't know\" or \"that we are uncertain about\" the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note:*** This view of probability does not imply that there is any randomness in the \"world\". Even if the world is purely deterministic (the behaviour of the die is only determined by the laws of physics and we could in principle be able to predict the outcome), we can still use probability to express the fact, how uncertain we are about the outcome. For example, if we know the exact rotation and speed of the die before it hitting the table, we might be able to reduce uncertainty about the outcome and make better predictions which could in turn be expressed as changing the probability distribution of the outcomes."
