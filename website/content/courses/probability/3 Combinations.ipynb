    "Combinations are a way to count the numbers of ways to choose $k$ objects from a set of $n$ objects without regard to order.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think about this in the following way: We have $n$ objects and order them in some way. Then we choose the first $k$ objects in the order. This intuition leads to the following rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are $n!$ ways to order $n$ objects. However, when we choose the first $k$ objects, the order of that subset doesn't matter. So, we have to divide out the number of ways to order the $k$ objects. This is $k!$. Similarly, the order of the remaining $n-k$ objects also doesn't matter, so we have to divide out $(n-k)!$."
