    "But how can we evaluate loss on data that the model hasn’t seen and that we haven't labeled? That seems impossible, right?  \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this, we use **proxies**:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Training Loss (Training Error):**  \n",
    "   The first proxy is the loss computed on the training data:\n",

In that case, even when evaluating on a test set, we would still be testing only on IKEA furniture. As a result, the model might perform well on this specific subset but fail to generalize to chairs from other brands, leading to **misclassifications**. This would cause our classifier to perform significantly worse on truly unseen data compared to what the test loss suggests.\n",
