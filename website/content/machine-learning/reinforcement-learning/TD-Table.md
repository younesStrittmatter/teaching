# 2 Temporal Difference Learning

## Table

Open the following link to see a *temporal difference learning* table in action. It is a small table with 3 states and 5 trials. Fill out the values for each state and trial manually to get a better understanding of how temporal difference learning works.

Tip: Fill out the full table and examine how the values and the prediction error change over time. Think about how the dopamine signal of the brain is related to the values you see. How would you describe what the brain "rewards" with the dopamine signal?
