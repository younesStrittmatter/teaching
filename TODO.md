## General

- Add index pages to the sections with tags for the specific sections. For example, add tag gradient descent and tag backpropagation to the section about classifiers. This way, the reader can easily find the information they are looking for.


## Specific

- In classifiers, "convex" is not explained (section gradient descent). I don't want to add a formal definition, but maybe a link to another page that explains if (maybe a course about optimization).
